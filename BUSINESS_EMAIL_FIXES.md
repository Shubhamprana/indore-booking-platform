# Business Registration Email Issues - FIXED âœ…

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### **Issue 1: Welcome Email Not Sent for Business Users**
**Problem**: Business users were only receiving the pro subscription bonus email but not the welcome email.

**Root Cause**: The registration flow in `lib/auth.ts` had conflicting logic between server-side and client-side email sending, causing the welcome email to fail.

**Solution**: 
- **File Modified**: `lib/auth.ts` (lines 227-250)
- **Fix**: Simplified the email sending logic to always use the API endpoint approach for consistency
- **Result**: Welcome emails now work reliably for both customer and business registrations

### **Issue 2: Referrer Not Getting Bonus Email for Business Referrals**
**Problem**: When a business user registers with a referral code, the person who referred them wasn't receiving an email notification about earning a free month of pro subscription.

**Root Cause**: The `processBusinessReferral` function in `lib/business-subscription.ts` only processed the database transaction but didn't send any email notifications to the referrer.

**Solution**:
- **File Modified**: `lib/business-subscription.ts` (lines 140-185)
- **Fix**: Added email notification system to send referrer bonus emails when business referrals are processed
- **Email Content**: Personalized message with referred business name and clear bonus details
- **Result**: Referrers now receive immediate email notifications when they earn free months
