After updating your credentials, test the email system:

1. **Register a new user** on your app

3. **Check your email inbox** for the welcome message

## ✅ Current Status

Your app is **production-ready** right now:
- ✅ Registration works perfectly
- ✅ Users get points/credits immediately
- ✅ All features work without emails
- ❌ Welcome emails not sending (but registration not blocked)

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Choose Brevo** (recommended) or fix Gmail
2. **Update your `.env` file** with new credentials
3. **Restart your server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Test registration** to confirm emails work
5. **Deploy to production** with the same credentials

## 🔧 Your Updated Email System

The email system now:
- Tries **Brevo first** (most reliable)
- Falls back to **Gmail** if Brevo fails
- **Never blocks registration** if emails fail
- Shows **detailed logs** in console
- **Queues emails** for retry if all providers fail
